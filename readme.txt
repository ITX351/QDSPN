We use the Forest dataset [1] as the real dataset, which has been used by many high-quality works [2, 3]. The dataset has 581,012 records, and each record has 54 attributes. We only select the first 10 attributes. For database queries, these 10 attributes have the largest variance and are the most meaningful. Other related studies have also selected these 10 attributes.
